*skycalc*  -- astronomical calculator -- uses easy commands to
   calculate such things as sidereal time, airmass, moon phase, 
   twilight, precession, heliocentric corrections, planetary 
   positions, and so on.  By and for professional observers.
Program is in c, should port without effort to most machines.  
   Comes with on-line help and complete manual (TeX and ps.)  
Package also includes a program for printing an astronomical  
   calendar (sunset, twilight, moon, etc.) for any site.

REVISIONS -- 1994 September --- bug fix (V4.1)

Works around a problem with incorrect dates (all zeros) printed on
Silcon Graphics and perhaps others.

REVISIONS -- 1994 September version (V4)

The calendar-printing program is unchanged from V3.  The calculator
program is considerably revised; the most important revisions are:

1) Can read a file of objects; user can then set to coordinates
   of an object by name or have the object list sorted according
   to a number of different criteria.  Very useful while observing.
2) Can produce a log file of output results while running interactively.
   [N. B. -- This feature requires a working ANSI c-compiler; the standard 
   Sun "cc" compiler fails, and the ANSI version "acc" fails
   because of a known compiler bug.  However, the Open Software
   Foundation's "gcc" compiler *does* create working code for
   sparcstations.  A binary version is distributed for those who
   need it.]  

REVISIONS -- 1994 Feb. --- new version (V3)

1) Can produce table of observability through an observing
   season -- for an accurate `range of acceptable dates'.
   Tabulates at new and full moon (hence shows dark/bright runs).
2) Can set time and date from system clock; convenient while
   observing.
3) Revised startup sequence offers new (or rusty) users a 
   fast tour of program -- volunteer test subjects (astronomers)
   learn program in 10 minutes or less.
